# Neural-Network-from-scratch-
Build a neural network class definition, where number of inputs, hidden layers and outputs with sigmoid activation function are defined. Built this network without using any machine learning libraries. The network from scratch is present in nn_from_scratch.py

<br>
nn_using_tf.py is the implementation of the network implemented in nn_from_scratch.py using tensorflow.
